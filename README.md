# Matrix Operations Program

This is a Kotlin program that allows you to perform various matrix operations, including:

- Adding matrices
- Multiplying a matrix by a constant
- Multiplying matrices
- Transposing a matrix
- Calculating the determinant of a matrix
- Finding the inverse of a matrix

## How to Use

1. Run the program:
    - Ensure you have Kotlin installed on your system.
    - Compile and run the program using your preferred Kotlin development environment or command-line tools.

2. Matrix Operations Menu:
    - The program provides a menu with options for different matrix operations.
    - Select an option by entering the corresponding number.

3. Matrix Input:
    - For operations that require matrix input (e.g., addition, multiplication, inversion), you will be prompted to enter the matrix size and values.

4. Result Display:
    - The program will display the result of the chosen operation.

## Example Usage

### Adding Matrices

```plaintext
Matrix Operations Menu:
1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
6. Inverse matrix
0. Exit
Your choice: 1

Enter size of the first matrix:
2 2
Enter matrix row 1 values (separated by spaces):
1.0 2.0
Enter size of the second matrix:
2 2
Enter matrix row 1 values (separated by spaces):
3.0 4.0

The result is:
4.0 6.0

Matrix Operations Menu:
1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix by a constant
3. Multiply matrices

6. Inverse matrix
0. Exit
Your choice: 4

Choose a type of transposition:
1. Main diagonal
2. Side diagonal
3. Vertical line
4. Horizontal line
Your choice: 1

Enter matrix size (rows columns):
